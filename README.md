This boilerplate assumes an understanding of using and configuring a project in Firebase and Firestore and setting up the auth.
Although it is assumed, it can help you learn the setup configuration in firebase by reading the [docs][firebaseuidocs].

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
